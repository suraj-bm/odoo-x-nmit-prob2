# Login Flow Test

## Issues Fixed

1. **Token Storage Inconsistency**: Fixed mismatch between `auth_token`/`refresh_token` (AuthContext) and `accessToken`/`refreshToken` (components)
2. **Missing Redirect**: Added automatic redirect to `/dashboard` after successful login/registration
3. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: Fixed `/users/users/me/` to `/users/users/profile/`
4. **Inconsistent Auth Usage**: Updated all components to use AuthContext instead of direct API calls

## Changes Made

### AuthContext (`src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Store tokens with both key variations for compatibility
- Added automatic redirect after login/registration
- Enhanced logout to clear all token variations and redirect

### Login Page (`src/app/loginpage/page.tsx`)
- Updated to use AuthContext instead of direct API calls
- Added loading states for better UX
- Added redirect check for already authenticated users

### Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Updated to use AuthContext for authentication state
- Added loading state while auth is being checked
- Enhanced token checking to support both key variations

### Sidebar (`src/components/sidebar.tsx`)
- Updated to use AuthContext for user data and logout
- Simplified logout function
- Added proper authentication checks

## Test Steps

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python manage.py runserver`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend/accountix && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/loginpage`
4. Try logging in with demo credentials:
   - Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
   - Invoicing: `invoicing` / `invoicing123`
5. Verify that login redirects to dashboard
6. Verify that logout redirects back to login page
7. Verify that accessing dashboard without login redirects to login page

## Expected Behavior

- Login should redirect to dashboard immediately after successful authentication
- Dashboard should only be accessible when authenticated
- Logout should clear all tokens and redirect to login page
- All components should use consistent authentication state
